# MCEME-drone-detection

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as
drones have witnessed a massive increase in the past few years.
Drones are not only being used for recreational purposes but
also in a vast number of applications in engineering, disaster
management, logistics, securing airports, etc. Extensive usage of
drones has immediately raised security concerns due to the
potential of their use in malicious activities. To address this
problem, this project is aimed at analysing the available drone
detection solutions which can identify drones from the day and
night camera feeds in real-time. This study also aims to identify
the potential challenges involved in drone detection and study
the various accuracy and loss metrics in drone detection
problems. Finally, the drone detection solutions will be
compared and a suitable COTS drone detection solution will be
suggested such that it gives the best trade-off between false
alarm and miss. The main focus of this project will be on object
detection methods with deep learning.
